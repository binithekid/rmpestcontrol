              House mouse or Mice can enter a property by many routes and even
              some air bricks allow mice access to a building. Kitchens tend to
              be highly preferred area for mice to infest therefore is the most
              likely place that you will encounter the mice as they will be
              searching for food. Mice are a UK wide problem for most residences
              and businesses.

              They are considered to be pests due to the fact that they are
              living creatures capable of transmitting deadly diseases like
              bubonic plague, leptospirosis, lymphocytic chorio-meningitis,
              rat-bite fever, salmonella, tapeworms and others. Mice can easily
              find their way into residential and commercial premises, and most
              likely to be prevalent in the areas where food is stored or near
              areas where rubbish is dumped. Their natural and constant gnawing
              habit means mice can also cause great damage to your property,
              furnishings and equipment.

              leave behind dark smudge marks that may appear on walls, skirting
              and other surfaces, onto which mice brush their bodies passing

              or place mouse bait in the detected areas. Enclose the food in

            <p className="text-gray-600text-sm md:text-base">
              Presence of rats inside the premises may lead to serious damage to
              the property as well as to the health of the people around. The
              situation gets worse when they start to breed inside the premises
              which increase their numbers altogether. Once they infest a
              property, these harmful rodents can usually be found underneath
              the kitchen units, behind bath panels, inside roof voids and sheds
              and in the kitchen garden and garden decking.
            </p>

            <h3 className="text-[1.4rem] mt-8 font-bold">Signs</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 text-sm md:text-base">
              Usual signs of the rat infestation are gnawed electrical wires,
              half chewed cereals or foods, nibbled plastic or even mild steel.
              At RM Pestokill we make sure that our technicians apply humane rat
              control methods authorized by necessary bodies governed by rat
              control UK. We use techniques that are not at all harmful to
              children or pets. We usually use taper proof plastic bait boxes
              and place them at strategic points in the premises in order to
              exterminate the infestation completely.
