          <p className="font-light text-sm md:text-base">
            Cockroaches are known to be a very high risk pest. Cockroaches are
            most active during the night. During the day they prefer to stay
            hidden in cracks and crevices, coming out to feed mostly at night
            time. Cockroaches are attracted to all types of food available in
            your home. They will eat anything from foods, paper, packaging,
            plastics and fabrics to animal matter.
          </p>
          <p className="font-light mt-2 md:mt-4 text-sm md:text-base">
            {" "}
            We minimise the risk of insects in the home by using non-toxic
            products, which are highly targeted at the crevices where
            cockroaches hide. Cockroach bait is either housed in a
            childproof-case or applied as a gel and contains a slow-working
            poison mixed in with an attractive food. It would also help for you
            to move yard debris away from the outside of the house. Cockroaches
            are usually nocturnal but where there is a heavy infestation you
            will often see them in the daytime. Their droppings will often be
            found wherever there is suitable food and will look similar to black
            pepper granules. A strong sour smell is often noticeable where there
            is a particularly heavy infestation and professional treatment is
            often needed to put an end to the problem.{" "}

            Their diet often consists of grease build up, leftover food,
            rubbish, and basically anything else they they can get to. This also
            includes other dead cockroaches as well as your stored food.
            Cockroaches infest your food cupboards and they are likely to
            contaminate anything they come in to contact with. They drop eggs
            and droppings everywhere they go. A cockroach infestation produces a
            lingering and unpleasant odour that taints items they contact.
